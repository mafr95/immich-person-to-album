# Immich Person-to-Album (Extended)

Automatically sync Immich photos to albums based on detected people with advanced AND/OR/NOT filtering operations.

Every run does a full sync: photos that newly match a link's criteria are added, and photos already
in the album that no longer match (e.g. a wrongly-assigned face was removed, or a person was merged/deleted)
are automatically removed again. Because the sync is exact, an album should only be targeted by one
`personLinks` rule, and photos manually added to that album will also be removed if they don't match the criteria.

## 🎯 Advanced Filtering (Extended Features)

This fork adds powerful filtering operations not available in the original project.

### ✅ AND Operation
Photos with **ALL** specified people together:

```json
{
  "description": "Both kids together",
  "personIds": ["kid-1-id", "kid-2-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "albumId": "both-kids-album"
}
```

### ✅ OR Operation (Default)
Photos with **ANY** of the specified people:

```json
{
  "description": "Either kid",
  "personIds": ["kid-1-id", "kid-2-id"],
  "operation": "OR",
  "albumId": "any-kid-album"
}
```

### ✅ NOT Operation
Exclude specific people:

```json
{
  "description": "Kid 1 without Kid 2",
  "personId": "kid-1-id",
  "excludePersonIds": ["kid-2-id"],
  "albumId": "kid-1-solo-album"
}
```

### ✅ Exclude Others
Photos with **ONLY** specified people (no one else):

```json
{
  "description": "Family of 4 only - no friends",
  "personIds": ["dad-id", "mom-id", "kid-1-id", "kid-2-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "excludeOthers": true,
  "albumId": "family-only-album"
}
```

### Combined Operations

**Both kids, but not with parents:**
```json
{
  "personIds": ["kid-1-id", "kid-2-id"],
  "operation": "AND",
  "excludePersonIds": ["dad-id", "mom-id"],
  "albumId": "kids-alone-album"
}
```

**Solo photos (person alone, no one else):**
```json
{
  "personId": "kid-1-id",
  "excludeOthers": true,
  "albumId": "kid-1-solo-album"
}
```

## 📋 Configuration Options

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | No | Human-readable description |
| `personId` | string | Yes* | Single person ID (original syntax) |
| `personIds` | array | Yes* | Multiple person IDs for AND/OR operations |
| `operation` | string | No | `"OR"` (default) or `"AND"` |
| `excludePersonIds` | array | No | Person IDs to exclude |
| `excludeOthers` | boolean | No | Exclude all other people not specified |
| `albumId` | string | Yes | Target album ID |

*Either `personId` or `personIds` must be specified.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Container can't reach Immich

```bash
# Test connectivity from inside container
docker exec immich-person-to-album sh -c "wget -qO- http://immich-server:2283/api/server/ping"

# Should return: {"res":"pong"}
```

**Fix:** Make sure both containers are on the same Docker network.

### Photos not being added or removed

1. Check logs: `docker logs immich-person-to-album`
2. Verify person IDs are correct
3. Verify album IDs are correct
4. Check API key has `asset.read`, `album.read`, `albumAsset.create` and `albumAsset.delete` permissions

---

## 📅 Schedule Format

Default: `*/30 * * * *` (every 30 minutes)

```
*/5 * * * *   = Every 5 minutes
0 * * * *     = Every hour
0 0 * * *     = Daily at midnight
0 */6 * * *   = Every 6 hours
```

---

## 🚫 Limitations

### Not Supported (Nested Boolean Logic)
- ❌ `(A && B) || (C && D)` - "Both A and B, OR both C and D"
- ❌ `A && (B || C)` - "A and either B or C"

For most use cases, the combination of AND, OR, NOT, and excludeOthers is sufficient.

## 🎉 Why This Fork?

**Immich Native Support**: This feature is on Immich's roadmap for late 2025, but not yet implemented.

**Why I Forked**: The original project only supported simple single-person albums. I needed:
- Multiple people with AND/OR logic
- Ability to exclude specific people
- Photos with ONLY specified people (no one else)

**Backward Compatible**: All original configuration syntax still works!
